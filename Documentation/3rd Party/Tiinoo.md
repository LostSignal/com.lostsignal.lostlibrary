* This code is if you're using the 3rd party plugin Tiinoo for a debug console log on device

* It has a TiinooManager that sole job is for instantiating the Tiinoo object into your scene for use

* Need to use Lost Signals version of the Tiinoo plugin for this to work
  * The Lost Signal version makes sure Tiinoo can run as a package
