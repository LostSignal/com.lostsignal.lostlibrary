* Remove Everything Ably

* Finish AppConfig -> BuildConfig renaming (make sure it just works with older projects)
  * appconfig was renamed to bootconfig, make sure source control (and template files) ignore it
    * add bootconfig and releaseconfig while we're at it
    * Also Add the following to to the ignore files
      * "Assets/AddressableAssetsData/*"

* Add Visual Scripting to Default git, p4 and plastic ignore files
  * **/Assets/Unity.VisualScripting.Generated/*
  * **/Assets/Unity.VisualScripting.Generated
  * **/Assets/Unity.VisualScripting.Generated.meta

* Update Bootloader system to have new BootConfig
  * Should also contain current release info
  * Clean out Release/AppVersion code when figured out
  * Make sure it supports Reboot

* Add UpdateManager
  * Remove UnityTask
  * Remove CoroutineRunner

* Add com.unity.coding libary as a dependency of lost libary

* Make a SafeAreaManager (will pre-built in safe area's for most popular iPhones)

* LostPlayerPrefs needs a refactor
  * DeviceStorage
    * App Open Count
    * Player Custom Ids
  * PlayerStorage
    * Stats
    * Achievements
  * GameStorage 
    * Flag System
    * Checkpoint info?  Saving and restoring to older version?
    * CreateSnapshot()
    * Rollback() (used by checkpoint system)
  * Add Reset File options for each type
  * Can DeviceStorage be reused for other systems like Analytics/Logging/PerfRecording Data, so we can save all that before sending up to the cloud?

* FlagManager System (how will it work with the Player/Game Storage System?)

* **CLEAN UP HAVEN CODE (remove all of the unity example projects code too)
  * Update XR Dialog Follow Code to:
    * https://forum.unity.com/threads/quaternion-smoothdamp.793533/
    * https://gist.github.com/maxattack/4c7b4de00f5c1b95a33b

* Turn Gameplay/Expereince/Experience.cs into "Level.cs"?
  * Basically a Level should be a scriptable object with a Main scene and chunck scenes.
  * Maybe even have a list of "Startup" scenes that should also be loaded
  * This way when you load the level, we know exactly how much to load
  * The LevelManager should handle all of these
  * Objects should also be able to tell the LevelManager that they are "Busy" doing work and the level manager won't fade up till that work is done.

* **PLAYFAB
  * Make PlayFab an optional dependency (so wrap all playfab code around USING_PLAYFAB)
  * Look at the WIP Folder for any CloudFunctions related code and move it into Cloud Funtions or delete it
  * Update all PlayFab Managers to use Async instead of UnityTask
  * Try to get PlayFab code (specially the caching) working in an outside C# project

* Make sure all cool Lost UGUI scripts have filters to Lost folder with AddComponentMenu

* Clean up any Behaviour code that I think shouldn't exist anymore (Maybe add ```[AddComponent("")]```)

* Add ScriptableObject Event System?
  * https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017
  * Events
    * On PlayerData Loaded
    * On PlayerData Before Save
    * On PlayerData After Save
    * On GameData Loaded
    * On GameData Before Save
    * On GameData After Save
    * On Checkpoint Snapshot
    * On Checkpoint Restore
    * On Player Death
    * On Object Pooled
  
  * Make sure Bolt Graphs can listen for these

* Remove WeakReference out of Experimental, shoudl be replaced with GuidBasedReferences

* Add Searchable Enum Property Drawer
  * https://github.com/roboryantron/UnityEditorJunkie/blob/master/Assets/SearchableEnum/Code/Editor/SearchableEnumDrawer.cs
  * https://github.com/fishtopher/UnityDrawers
  

* DissonanceManager should print error if "Microphone Usage Description" is empty on iOS

* LiveSwitchManger should print error if "Camera Usage Description" is empty on iOS

* Local Notifications and Push Notification managers
  * Local Notifications Manager (based on Unity's wrapper)
  * Lost.PlayFab should look for a PushNotifications manager if USING_LOST_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS is on
  * Register for is ready and send up RegisterForIOSPushNotification/RegisterForAndroidPushNotification


* SpriteAtlasLoadingManger custom editor has been broken
* UnityPurchasingManager needs to have a "Is Enable" settings, and print errors if not properly installed
* Add XRManagerSettings (use this instead of IsXRApp)
* Make Settings for PlayFabAnalyticsProvider
* Is Lost Library Codebase completely static instance free?  Can I safely reboot an app without messing this up?
* What about Pooler system.  Should probably move that to Releases
  * Also, how good am I about using the Pooling system in the app?
* Get 2FA Login working (will require some anonymous functions)
  * Will need to define these in Releases?
* Update Reference Tool to figure out the exact location of the bad reference
* **MAKE SURE TextObjectEditor SETS IT DIRTY WHEN IT'S SUPPOSE TO
* Make sure BuildConfigs, GameServerGenerator, AzureFunctionsGenerator and BootConfig are 
  all autogenerated and registered with EditorBuildSettings
    * EditorBuildSettings.AddConfigObject(Namespace, editorAppConfig, true);

* Pooling System needs to use the new Manager System
  * Delete SingletonUtil.cs after the move is complete
  * Need to detect if a pooled object is being destroyed?
  * If it's not being destroyed during app shutdown then print an error (Platform.IsShuttingDown)?
  * Would it make more sense to not put a Pooled component on the object and instead keep a HashSet of Instance Ids?


* **MAKE LAYOUT GROUP DISABLER COMPONENT (MAYBE ALL DIALOGS HAVE THIS AS A REQUIRED COMPONENT?)
  * This scans your dialog for all layout groups and waits x seconds before disabling them after a show

* GameObjectState Component (Move, Scale, Rotate, Tint), make networkable
    * Animator ones should have a flag, disable Animator when finished (defaulted to true)
    * Add Showable exist in the project?
      * Will it use ObjectState component with Show/Hide under the hood?

* Scan all code bad line endings and print warnings if find files with bad line endings
  or messed up line endings "\r\r\n"
