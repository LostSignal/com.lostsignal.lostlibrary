# To Do
* Working on putting all these packages into thier own namespaces.
* Working on turning these packages into proper Unity Package Manager packages (or one giant one)
* Add assembly definition files for all the packages.
* Better defining and simplifying the package dependency graph

### Packages that may need splitting up
* AppConfig  (May need to move all EditorGrid/Helper code to a project named EditorGUI)

### Packages that may need combining
* EditorTools
* Extensions
* Localization
* Pooling
* Singleton
* Storage
* Utilities
