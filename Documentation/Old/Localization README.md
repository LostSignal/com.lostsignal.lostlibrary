# Lost.Localization Package

### Description
----------------
This package contains the Localization system for the Lost Library.

### To Do
----------
* Update IntText to remember the last SetText string and format, so if it detects a language change it can fix it itself.
* Make an AppConfig for Localization that lets me specify the supported languages and the default language.
* Update the Language menu option generator to use the AppConfig to figure out what to generate
* Use this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation for figuring out sub languages
* This will rely's on AppConfig runtime properties, is there a way we don't have to use that so we can update languages withoug an app update?!?!?!?

### Dependencies
