* Make sure every project uses the AppConfig system.
  * Example:  Lost.Logging should have a LostLoggingAppConfig that (if enabled) will turn on the "USING_LOST_LOGGING" define
  * Also, should have an option for Initializing at startup
    * This would mean that all AppConfigs should also have a RuntimeInitializeOnLoad virtual method as well

* Rename AR to XR
  * Move Interactables to that folder?
