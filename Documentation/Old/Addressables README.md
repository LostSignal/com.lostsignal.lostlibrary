# Lost.Addressables Package

### Description
----------------
This package contains a helper library for putting your addressable assets into either S3 or Azure Blog Storage.

### To Do
----------
* Finish Documentation

### Dependencies
-----------------
Lost.AppConfig

### Note
-------------------
* I also have some old code that would upload AssetBundles to a FTP server.  I haven't created an AppConfig for that option yet, but it should be fairly trivial.
