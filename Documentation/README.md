# Lost Library

A helpful Unity framework that ranges from Singletons, Input Abstraction, Unity Cloud Build helpers, Smart Coroutines, App Initialization and more.  This code base is used in every one of Lost Signals Applications/Games.  It's been an ever evolving project over the last 5+ years.  We're always trying to make it better and easier to use.  We also feel that lots of people can really benifit from our work so we're releasing it to the public under the MIT License.
